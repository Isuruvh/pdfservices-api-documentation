# Overview
<p>
Adobe PDF Embed API allows you to embed a PDF viewer in your web applications with only a few lines of code. With options for controlling how a PDF appears and functions, your applications can deliver the rich and compelling digital document experiences to your customers expect and need.


Easy-to-use, JavaScript-based interfaces are the PDF Embed API's
foundation. Simplicity is designed in so that developers can harness the
power of integrated PDF in their web content. With the ability to
natively display PDF in an environment you control, you no longer need
to rely on Reader download buttons, 3rd party apps, and PDF viewers that
care little for PDF standards. With web-based JavaScript and in-page JS
options, displaying a PDF on the web couldn't be easier. And it's
simple: a few of lines of code are all you need to get started.
